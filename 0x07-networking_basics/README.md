# Networking basics #0

This is a readme file containing ALX System Engineering Devops in Shell Programming Language about Networking Basics.

This project was the first of two introducing networking concepts. In this project, I answered a few quiz-like questions and wrote a couple bash scripts while learning about the OSI model, Internet and MAC address, LAN and WAN networks, and TCP/UDP data transfer protocols.
